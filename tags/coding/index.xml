      <description>I recently started reading, A byte of python, and found it a very helpful guide to the language for a beginner. The book was well-written, and explained most of important concepts in simple terms with self evident examples to follow. Thus, it made learning Python simple and interesting.
As a R programmer, I found that those sections such as modules, data structures and OOP are important to understand the basic building blocks of Python and how to make connection with the language that Iâ€™m more familiar with.</description>

      <description>Recently, my coworker, a full-stack developer, recommended me to build a personal site with Hugo, an open-source static site generator and Github. Overall, the experience with setting up a site is quite pleasant. There are some hoops to jump through such as a proper way to deploy generated contents on Github and finding the math typesetting library that works well on major browsers.
In this post, I will share five simple steps to create a static site in no time.</description>
